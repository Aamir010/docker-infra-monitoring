# Infrasturcture Monitoring with Docker

## Note:- There should be realatively easiest approach when your run Docker Enginer on Swarm mode. This solution is only applicable when you wants to monitor standalone docker engine.

## Components Use:-
1. Consul
2. Prometheus
3. Node-Exporter
4. Registrator
5. Grafana

## Flow: -
 
Everything is working here as a Docker Container.
 
We are using **Consul(Standalone Cluster)** as a service discovery tools which register each node that is going to monitor by Prometheus.
**Node-Exporter** is run as a container on each node that will gather all system related matrix.
**Prometheus** will works on pull model so it will query consul to get the node details and based on available result it will scrape matrix from Node-Exporter. We can also create alert rule on Prometheus so it will alert on email or slack when predefine event has been occurs.
**Registrator** is deploy as a container on every node so it will keep track on each services state that should be monitor by Prometheus.
**Grafana** is providing Graphs UI where we can create multiple dashboard and best way to understand whatâ€™s going on in our system. Grafana is connect with Prometheus data source to get data to be ploted on graphs.


# Run Consul standalone container on your monitoring machine
```
docker run -d -h node \
 --name=consul-cluster \
 -p 8500:8500 -p 8600:53/udp \
  progrium/consul \
  -server -bootstrap \
  -log-level debug

```

# Run Prometheus on your monitoring machine
```
docker run -p 9090:9090 \
 -d -v $PWD/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
 --name prometheus \
 prom/prometheus:v1.6.3

```

# Run Grafana on your monitoring machine
```
docker run -d \
 -p 3000:3000 \
 --name grafana \
 grafana/grafana

```

# Run Registrator on every machine
```
docker run -d \
 --name=registrator \
 --net=host \
 --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock \
 gliderlabs/registrator:latest \
 -ip="<Local_IP_Address>" \
 consul://<Consul_IP_Address>:8500

```


# Run Node-Exporter on every machine

```
docker run -d \
 -p 9100:9100 \
 -v /proc:/host/proc \
 -v /sys:/host/sys \
 -v /:/rootfs \
 prom/node-exporter \
 -collector.procfs=/host/proc \
 -collector.sysfs=/host/proc \
 -collector.filesystem.ignored-mount-points="^/(sys|proc|dev|host|etc)($$|/)"

```
